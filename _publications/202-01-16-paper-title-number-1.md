excerpt: 'Our study introduces an innovative, automated paradigm for HRA data collection through a scenario-driven approach that accurately estimates operator workload in collaborative settings. By fine-tuning large language models on high-temperature gas-cooled reactor operational data, our method simulates human behavior and cognitive load in real time, dynamically adapting to workload changes.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed workload estimation with LLMs and agents (WELLA) method outperforms existing LLM-based approaches in prediction accuracy.'
