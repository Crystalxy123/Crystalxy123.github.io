## Research Interest
I am a researcher whose work focuses on four key areas:
* The construction of HRA data collection and analysis systems.
* The study and implementation of human-machine collaboration mechanisms.
* The development of innovative HRA methodologies that integrate data-driven approaches with cognitive theories (ACT-R).
* The dynamic, intelligent identification and risk prevention/control of human factors failure traps in the new era.
