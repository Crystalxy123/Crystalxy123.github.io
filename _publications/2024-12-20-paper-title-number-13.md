In southeastern China, village-level industrial parks have become hubs of compact enterprise clustering, often involving multiple businesses operating across several floors of shared industrial buildings. While this improves land use efficiency, it significantly increases risks due to inter-enterprise proximity and potential domino effects.

To address these challenges, we developed a bi-objective layout optimization model that balances risk reduction with rental profit maximization. Unlike traditional approaches that focus solely on cost, our model explicitly considers safety risks—including floor-based location risks and interaction risks between neighboring enterprises—and economic returns through rent optimization.

This approach empowers park managers to visualize the trade-offs between risk and revenue, offering a spectrum of layout solutions tailored to both safety and profitability goals. A real-world case study in Shunde, Guangdong, validated the model’s effectiveness, demonstrating its promise for widespread application.

Potential applications include: intelligent planning of new industrial zones, safety-driven redesign of existing enterprise clusters, and decision support in urban industrial land redevelopment.


在中国东南部地区，村级工业园区密集发展，多家企业被集中安排在多层标准厂房中。这种空间集约的模式虽然提升了土地利用率，但也带来了新的安全挑战：企业间的相互影响、不同楼层的风险差异，以及潜在的多米诺效应。

为应对这一问题，我们提出了一种双目标优化布局模型，旨在帮助园区在**“降低风险”与“提高收益”之间实现最佳平衡**。与传统只关注成本的布局方式不同，我们的研究首次将安全风险（包括楼层位置风险与企业之间的关联风险）与租金收益并列为优化目标。

该模型可以为园区管理者提供多种可选布局方案，清晰展示“高收益”与“低风险”之间的权衡关系，为科学决策提供有力支撑。目前，该方法已在广东顺德的实际工业园区中进行了测试验证，展示了良好的实用性与推广前景。

应用前景包括：新型工业园区的智能规划、产业集聚区的安全监管优化，以及城市更新过程中工业用地的再布局决策支持。
