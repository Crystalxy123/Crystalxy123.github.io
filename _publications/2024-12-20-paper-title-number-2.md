While estimating human error probability (HEP) is key, current methods rely on subjective, time-consuming expert input. Inspired by large language models (LLMs), we propose a novel two-stage, knowledge-driven framework (KRAIL) integrating IDHEAS and LLMs for semi-automated base HEP computation. Leveraging knowledge graphs as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), the framework efficiently processes relevant data. Evaluations on authoritative human reliability datasets demonstrate superior performance in estimating base HEP under partial information, offering an innovative approach to reliability assessment.
