title: "A text intelligence-based approach for automatic generation of fault trees in nuclear power plants"
collection: publications

permalink: /publication/2024-02-17-paper-title-number-4
excerpt: 'Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) is vital for high-stakes industries like nuclear power but requires complex, interdisciplinary expertise. This study presents NuLLM-FTG, which employs large language models and supervised fine-tuning on a specially designed textual structure to streamline FTA. Evaluations—via online experiments, expert reviews, and integration with Risk Spectrum—demonstrate that NuLLM-FTG matches expert-level performance, even outperforming GPT-4 in some cases, thereby enabling novice involvement in FTA.'
