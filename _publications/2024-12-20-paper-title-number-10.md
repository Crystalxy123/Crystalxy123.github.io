As COVID-19 swept across the globe, governments faced an unprecedented dilemma: how to balance effective epidemic control with economic stability. But with widely varying national characteristics—such as government efficiency, public trust, and healthcare capacity—making informed, tailored decisions remains an enormous challenge.

In this work, we introduce the National Risk Analysis Model (NRAM), an integrated decision support tool combining Bayesian networks, expert knowledge, and real-world data. NRAM models the interdependencies among a broad range of social, institutional, and public health indicators to assess and predict epidemic risks at a national scale.

The model enables both risk forecasting and critical factor identification, offering valuable insights for strategic planning. Our results demonstrate that education level and government response measures are among the most influential factors in reducing transmission risk—offering clear policy directions for both short-term crisis management and long-term resilience building.

Beyond COVID-19, NRAM provides a scalable, adaptable framework for national-level risk analysis in future public health or socio-economic emergencies.


面对席卷全球的COVID-19疫情，各国政府需要在“防疫”和“经济”之间做出平衡。然而，不同国家的社会结构、政府能力、医疗资源等千差万别，如何科学评估不同国家的疫情风险并制定精准决策，成为一大挑战。

本研究提出了国家级疫情风险评估模型（NRAM），通过整合专家知识、历史数据与贝叶斯网络推理技术，构建出一个可以量化多个社会、政策、健康指标之间关系的智能风险分析工具。

该模型不仅可以预测未来疫情发展趋势，还能帮助政府识别最关键的干预点。例如，结果表明“教育水平”与“政府管理措施的严格程度”是决定疫情扩散程度的两个关键因素。这为政府在紧急状态下提供了精准的策略依据。

NRAM的设计理念具有广泛推广价值，可为未来其他公共卫生危机和国家级风险管理提供系统性分析框架。
